/**
 * Majority Judgment API
 * This is a **deliberation service** using **majority judgment** polling. It\'s **libre software** ([source](https://github.com/mieuxvoter)) made and maintained by [MieuxVoter.fr](https://mieuxvoter.fr). You\'re browsing the API documentation and sandbox.  ## Use one of the known clients  - TODO: add an URL to a client of the API   ## Try it out the hard way  ### Create an account  You will need a user account to interact with polls. Head to **Registration** â†’ `POST /users` below. Click _Try it out_, set your desired credentials, and execute the query. Scroll down to see the response.  ### Authenticate  Use your credentials in the **Login** â†’ `POST /_jwt`, and the API will return a Json Web Token valid for one hour. Copy the token (not the whole response, and without quotes) in the field behind the `Authorize ðŸ”’` button.  ### Create a poll  **Poll** â†’ `POST /polls`  Keep the response, you\'ll need the uuids.  > TODO: document invitation generation  ### Submit judgments  **Ballot** â†’ `POST /polls/{pollId}/proposals/{proposalId}/ballots`  One request per proposal, for now.  We plan on making an endpoint to submit them all at once.  ### Collect the results  **Result** â†’ `GET /polls/{id}/result`  ## Use a generated client library  - for php  (link!) - for typescript-node  (link!!) - â€¦  There are clients we can generate for most languages. Get in touch if you\'d like one in particular! Or clone this project and use `bin/generate-client.bash -t whatever`.
